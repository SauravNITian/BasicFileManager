# BasicFileManager
A basic file manager implemented in C++ serves as a fundamental tool for navigating, organizing, and manipulating files and directories on a computer's file system. Here's a description of its functionalities:

1. **Directory Navigation**: The file manager allows users to traverse through directories, displaying the contents of each directory, including files and subdirectories.

2. **File Listing**: It provides a list of files within the current directory, along with relevant information such as file size, date modified, and permissions.

3. **File Operations**:
   - **Creating Files and Directories**: Users can create new files and directories within the current directory.
   - **Copying and Moving Files**: Files can be copied or moved to other directories.
   - **Deleting Files and Directories**: Users can delete unwanted files and directories, with appropriate confirmation prompts.

4. **File Information**: Users can access detailed information about a specific file, such as its size, permissions, and date created/modified.

5. **Search Functionality**: The file manager may include a search feature to help users locate specific files or directories based on their names or attributes.

6. **User Interface**: It provides a user-friendly interface, possibly with a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI), to facilitate easy interaction with the file system.

Overall, a basic file manager in C++ serves as a practical utility for file manipulation tasks, empowering users to efficiently organize and manage their digital assets on their computer.
